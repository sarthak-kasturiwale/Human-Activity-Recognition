# Human-Activity-Recognition
- This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.  
- This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. 
- The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

# End Results
- Ater applying all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques on the Dataset the SVM gives the highest accuracy on the test data i.e Linear SVC gives accuracy about 96.61%.
- Alternatively, we can use Logistic Regression also and if we train the LSTMs for more layers we could get better accuracy.
